# OSP Suite Workshops at QSP Conference in Leiden, Netherlands (April 21st and 25th, 2020)

## Two 1-Day PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® workshops on PBPK and PBPK-based QSP 

esqLABS is running two hands-on **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** workshops on **PBPK and PBPK-based QSP** on **Tuesday and Saturday 21st and 25th of April 2020** as (pre & post) satellite meetings to the **QSPC 2020 Meeting in Leiden, Netherlands**.

The workshops cover the **basics of PBPK** and concepts and application of **combining PK-Sim, MoBi and R** to build your very own digital platforms for the prediction of clinical trial outcomes by leveraging physiological and mechanistic knowledge to translate early in-vitro and preclinical outcomes to the clinic. 

Within the two workshops, you will learn how to:

**Workshop 1 / Day 1:**
- [x] Build a PBPK model in PK-Sim and compare to observed data
- [x] Learn how to model drug-drug interactions in PK-Sim (**DDI**)
- [x] Learn how to consider age-dependency in drug PK in PK-Sim (**Pediatric Analyses**)
- [x] Conduct population simulations in PK-Sim and MoBi

**Workshop 2 /Day 2:**
- [x] Integrate **mechanism-based pharmacodynamics** in MoBi
- [x] Conduct **parameter identifications** in PK-Sim and MoBi
- [x] Simulate and analyze your PBPK-QSP model in **R**

The two workshops will be held by the consultants and scientists from esqlabs GmbH with extensive experience in the use of **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** in all application areas. 

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.

## REGISTRATION

You can register for each workshop separately or for both at a reduced price.

You can Register on Eventbrite:
- [Register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/qspc2020-pbpk-with-pk-sim-mobi-osp-suite-registration-86318114805) and select either: DAY 1 only, DAY 2 only, or BOTH days.

Each workshop day is currently restricted to 15 participants.

Registration includes coffee- and lunch breaks.

## AGENDA

The use-cases within the workshops will be based on published examples. 

We will develop PBPK models for small molecules for DDI and pediatric populations and PBPK models for biologics (antibody-drug conjugates (AsDC)), which we develop into a PB-QSP model for treatment of tumor growth.  

The two workshop days are scheduled as follows:

### Day 1 (21st April, 2020)
